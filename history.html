      <h2> History </h2>

      <p>Ithaca has deep humble agricultural roots, especially with New York State being the second largest producer of apples in the US.</p>

      <p>These roots go deeper than just the start of Apple Fest. It turns out that the native Iroquois in the Finger Lakes would hold celebrations each season to celebrate their harvest.</p>

      <p>The festival as we know it today, came into fruition in 1985 when Anna Steinkraus and a few other enthusiastic local farmers wanted there to be a local celebration for their bountiful harvests. From this excited bunch, the annual Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival was created.</p>

      <p>Anna Steinkraus is the co-owner of Littletree Orchards and was the President of the Ithaca Farmer’s Market board of directors. She hasn’t missed a single one of the festivals since it started 36 years ago! You can find her and say “Hi” at the Littletree Orchards booth! If you don't know where to find it just look for a long line. Since they will be selling their popular apple cider donuts!</p>
