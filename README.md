# project2
For this project I was asked to redesign the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival Website with the target audience in mind. I considered what information would be most essential for the user to know and how to visually organize it. Here is a link to what the website I had to base my redesign off of looks like https://www.downtownithaca.com/apple-harvest-festival/

The documents folder contains "design journey," which goes over how I came to the decisions I made in regards to my design.
